        "In this tutorial, we explained the best practices to follow in order to create a general-purpose aggregation building block, represented as an aggregation factory. The generality comes through the design intent in two ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. *Parameterized computations.* Aggregation is an independent building block that can be plugged into other TFF modules designed to work with `tff.aggregators` to parameterize their necessary aggregation, such as `tff.learning.build_federated_averaging_process`.\n",
        "1. *Aggregation composition.* An aggregation building block can be composed with other aggregation building blocks to create more complex composite aggregations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Nevertheless, following these best practices is not necessary to create a custom aggregation that can be used in other modules, such as `tff.learning`. When experimenting with a new idea, it is often most productive to first hard-code the aggregation factory for a narrow use case, such as a fixed `value_type`, and it will work. \n",
        "\n",
        "These best practices are rather a default set of targets when writing a general aggregation building block which could be potentially upstreamed to TFF. Deviation from these targets is possible, based on the intended purpose of a novel aggregation factory.\n",
